UBERCAF Project Manifest
===================

To initialize your local repository use

    repo init -u https://github.com/UBERCAF/manifest.git -b oreo

Then to sync up:

    repo sync -f --no-tags --no-clone-bundle

Threads are reasonably accounted for, but you can override them with the -jX argument
